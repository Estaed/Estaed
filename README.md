# Hi there 👋, I'm Estaed

## I build Artificial Intelligences for games using Reinforcement and Imitation Learning

🎮 I’m passionate about creating intelligent agents that interact with game environments.  
Currently, I'm working on projects involving **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Imitation Learning (IL)** to explore how AI can learn and adapt in dynamic, interactive worlds.

🌱 I’m diving deeper into **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Game AI systems**

💼 I enjoy building practical, hands-on projects that **connect theory with real gameplay**

🧠 Always curious about **what’s under the hood** — especially algorithms, models, and mechanics

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools I work with:
- Python 🐍
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Git & GitHub
- SQL

### 🚀 Best Projects:

- 🛡️ **Project Taric UNDER DEVELOPMENT**  
A set of three interconnected repositories aimed at building a custom AI environment and agent for League of Legends-style gameplay using RL and IL:
  - 🔁 [Taric AI Agent](https://github.com/Estaed/Taric_AI_Agent): A reinforcement learning agent that learns to support in a simulated LoL environment.  
  - 🧪 [LoL Sim Env](https://github.com/Estaed/Lol_Sim_Env): A custom Gym environment built to simulate simplified lane behavior for Taric.  
  - 🌐 [LoL Data MCP Server](https://github.com/Estaed/Lol_Data_MCP_Server): A middleware that collect datas for both environment and AI agent.

- 🔴 **[Connect4 AI](https://github.com/Estaed/Connet4_AI)**  
A comprehensive Connect4 reinforcement learning system featuring self-play training with PPO algorithm. Includes hybrid CPU-GPU architecture, vectorized training environments (100-10,000 parallel games), and multiple game modes. Train your own Connect4 champion and watch it evolve from random moves to strategic gameplay!

- 🎮 [Doom AI](https://github.com/Estaed/Doom-AI)  
A reinforcement learning agent trained to play Doom using DQN and PPO. The project compares these algorithms to evaluate performance in a fast-paced FPS.

- 🍄 [Mario AI](https://github.com/Estaed/Mario-AI)  
An AI agent trained with PPO and DQN to play Mario. Focuses on comparing performance and generalization in classic platformer challenges.
